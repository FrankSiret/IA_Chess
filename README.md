# IA_Chess

chess game programmed with visual studio 2012
the artificial intelligence used is from "crafty" open sources

until now it's only available play with white pieces, in the future I will work in base of them.
This is a project from 2013, where I begin know to programming, but the logic and visual interface is programmed very well

enjoy!!

The game it's already compiled in "https://github.com/FrankSiret/Chess_IA/Chess_IA/bin/Debug" folder
